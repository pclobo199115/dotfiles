# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are the hidden files, those which start with a ".". These are also know as configuration files. So, in this repo, I store and automate the deployment of my dotfiles.
This includes:
- Xorg configuration files
- Status Bar scripts
- Various automation scripts

# Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pclobo199115/dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
